Hello World,  
&nbsp;  
Today I had an interesting realization.  I found myself struggling with a classical pitfall - over engineering.  
&nbsp;  
The task was simple. Design a Google Form that can take people’s feedback on my game. Each question should be well-thought-out. It should have a purpose and help solve a design decision in some way. But at the same time, the form should not be too long. After all, Google Forms doesn’t save responses for incomplete submissions.  
&nbsp;  
I have a background in data. And so naturally my mind first went into finding ways to ensure high data quality. As they say, garbage in, garbage out. I started creating conditional sections that would ask follow-up questions based on previous responses. I slowly realized that I was making a mess. The first person to test my form was my husband. I had chunked the form into so many pieces that it became cumbersome to click through the sections. And without a progress bar, I could see his patience waning.  
&nbsp;  
A compromise was to be made. Give up some data checks and make a more user-friendly form. In the end, I was much happier with this result. Meh, it only took me twice as long as it would someone else.  
&nbsp;
