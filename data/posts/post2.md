Hello World,  
&nbsp;  
I'd like to share an interesting story.  
&nbsp;  
After the 2001 Attacks, Est√©e Lauder noted their company sales of lipstick went up. Later owner Leonard publicized the Lipstick Effect, a hypothesis that in times of economic crisis, consumers are more likely to buy less costly luxury goods. Instead of buying expensive purses and fur coats, for example, people will buy expensive cosmetics, such as high-end brands of lipstick. The underlying assumption is that when consumer trust in the economy is dwindling, a certain portion of consumers will still buy luxury goods even during a bad economy.  
&nbsp;  
Why am I talking about Lipstick?  
&nbsp;  
I believe this hypothesis works outside the cosmetic industry. Due to the US tax war, 2025 has been a rocky year economically. So where do people turn to? The answer is board games.
