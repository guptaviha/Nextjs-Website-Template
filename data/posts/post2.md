Hello World,  
&nbsp;  
I'd like to share an interesting story I came across.  
&nbsp;  
After the 2001 Attacks, cosmetic company, Est√©e Lauder noted that their company sales of lipstick went up. Later, owner Leonard publicized the **Lipstick Effect**, a hypothesis that in times of economic crisis, consumers are more likely to buy less costly luxury goods.  
&nbsp;  
Instead of buying expensive purses and fur coats, for example, people will buy expensive cosmetics, such as high-end brands of lipstick. The underlying assumption is that when consumer trust in the economy is dwindling, a certain portion of consumers will still buy luxury goods even during a bad economy.  
&nbsp;  
Why am I talking about lipstick?  
&nbsp;  
Why would this phenomenon be unique to the cosmetic industry? 2025 has been a rocky year economically, thanks to the US Tariff Trade War. So where do people turn to? The answer is **board games**.
