Hello World,  
&nbsp;  
Last month I decided to quit my job. I was a software engineer being paid a comfortable six-figure salary in NYC. I loved writing code but I started feeling like I was stagnating in my role. I took the leap by submitting a resignation letter to my manager and I haven't looked back since.  
&nbsp;  
Did I have a plan? Not really.  
All I knew was that this time would never come again, and I needed to make the most of it.  
&nbsp;  
My first two weeks were spent enjoying my new-found freedom. Started playing tennis and eating right. It felt liberating to have no responsibilities for once. I had a lot of free time on my hands and that got me thinking.  
&nbsp;  
Younger me always dreamed of starting something of her own. I would always wonder what on earth I could have to offer the world. My passion for board games led me to an answer.  
&nbsp;  
On my last trip to Mumbai, India I played an Indian board game called *Bharata 600 BC* and I fell in love. There had to be a market for beautifully designed games like these. Something that was the perfect mix of strategy and simplicity. With a hint of nostalgia.  
&nbsp;  
That's when I started to make a plan. I got to work. Without the slightest clue of what I was signing up for.  
After all, if not now, then when?
