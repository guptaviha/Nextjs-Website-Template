# Next.js Website Template

A modern website template based on the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React framework built in TypeScript using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Be sure to explore the [demo](https://www.vihagupta.com/) to my personal website.

Use this template as a starter for your next website. Just download, make your edits, and host it on any free server. 

## Features
 - Responsive design: Built for device responsiveness across laptops, tablets, and phones
 - Ready-to-use: Just replace your data in one central file
 - Flexible: Made using Chakra components. Easy to customize to your specific needs
 - Dark Mode: Support for dark mode available

## Simple Steps to Host
1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Navigate to the ```/data``` dir. Make your edits to the file names ```data.ts```
3. Install npm on your machine if you havent already done so. (Tutorial [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows))
4. To see the website in action on your local machine, run the following command
    ```npm run dev```
5. The site should be visible on ```localhost:3000``` in your browser
6. Make sure to push your changes to a GitHub repo
7. Once ready to host, you can head on to a tool like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to make it live. Just sign up, create a new site, link your GitHub repo and enjoy!
